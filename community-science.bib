  abstract = {Previous efforts to evaluate the climate change impact of researchers have focused mainly on transport related impact of conference attendance, and infrastructure. Because these represent only a part of the activities involved in the science making process this short note presents the carbon footprint of a complete science making process of one specific case. Apart from presenting the total footprint, we evaluate the relative contribution of the different scientific activities, and quantify mitigating possibilities. The case PhD project had a carbon footprint of 21.5 t CO2-eq (2.69 t CO2-eq per peer-reviewed paper, 0.3 t CO2-eq per citation and 5.4 t CO2-eq per h-index unit at graduation) of which general mobility represents 75\%. Conference attendance was responsible for 35\% of the carbon footprint, whereas infrastructure related emissions showed to contribute 20\% of the total impact. Videoconferencing could have reduced the climate change impact on this case PhD with up to 44\%. Other emission reduction initiatives, such as using green electricity, reduction of energy consumption, and promoting commuting by bicycle, could have triggered a reduction of 14\% in this case study. This note fits in the movement of academics and universities willing to be green. The study confirms that researchers' mobility is the biggest contributor to his or her carbon footprint, but is not limited to conference attendance, showing the importance of considering all activities in the science making process.},

Postdocs enter the queue as they start their first postdoctoral appointment, and they leave in one of two ways: (i) obtaining the `queue service' desired by the majority of postdocs, that is, an assistant professorship, or (2) reneging from the queue and seeking other positions. Using recent data from the US Survey of Doctorate Recipients, we show that the postdoc queue is one of those rare queueing systems where most of the queuers eventually renege rather than receive service. We find that only about 17\% of postdocs ultimately land tenure-track positions. The mean time in queue (postdoc career length) is 2.9 years, with significant variations across disciplines.

  abstract = {Background Better access for clinicians from low- and middle-income countries to international conferences can improve collaborative opportunities and subsequently address the knowledge gap between the weaker and stronger knowledge economies. A better understanding of the cost of international conferences may help conference organisers improve access to their conferences. This study aimed to describe the expense-associated barriers to a selection of international emergency medicine and critical care conferences, in terms of registration cost and out-of-pocket expense. Methods A cross sectional, retrospective design was used. Registration cost variables (cost, waivers, discounts and scholarships) were collected from a cohort of international emergency medicine and critical care conferences held during 2016. The World Health Organization Purchasing Power Parity index was then applied to calculate an equitable registration cost for delegates from South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, China, Australia, Germany and the United States for each conference. Results Twenty conferences were included. Eight conferences (36\%) offered discounted rates, and another eight offered scholarships for low- and middle-income country delegates. Calculated, equitable registration rates were 2.6, 1.9, 1.9, 1.7, 0.9, 1.1 times lower than quoted respectively for South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, China, Australia and Germany compared to the rate in United States dollar. Only one conference provided equitable registration rates for all test-countries. Discussion Current international conference registration costs (despite discounts, waivers and scholarships) are likely a barrier to including low- and middle-income delegates in the educational, networking and promotional opportunities that conferences provide. Conference organisers should consider restructuring registration costs to encourage more representative international audiences.},

  abstract = {Across many disciplines, women are underrepresented in faculty positions relative to men. The present research focuses on the academic conference as a setting because it is a gateway to an academic career and a context in which women might experience sexism. We surveyed 329 presenters (63\% women) from three U.S. national academic conferences, which differed in women-to-men ratios, about their perceptions of the conference climate, their coping tactics (e.g., gender performance, silence, or voice), and their intentions to exit the conference or academia. The greater the representation of women at the conference relative to men, the less likely were women to perceive sexism and to feel they had to behave in a masculine manner in that setting. In contrast, women who perceived the conference as sexist and felt silenced also expressed increased intentions to exit from academic careers. Men's perceptions of sexism predicted increased intentions to exit from that particular conference, but not from academia. Because conferences signal the norms of a discipline, it is important to explore their climates as they relate to gender. Perhaps especially for new and aspiring female academics, they may signal devalued status and lack of fit and as such play an inadvertent role in the ``leaky pipeline.'' We discuss strategies that conference organizers could implement to mitigate sexist climates, including broader inclusion of women in speaking and leadership roles and explicit attention to cues that women belong.},

In this paper, we use collaborative autoethnography to engage in inquiry about the roles of conferences, and their inhabited notions of representation, membership and inclusion/exclusion. We use personal experiences of virtual confer-ring to highlight that many agreed-upon purposes of attending conferences can be effectively achieved through other means. We explore how particular ways of engaging with technologies enable responsive gathering spaces, relational knowledge production, kinship and community; and facilitate the development, and promotion of scholars and scholarship. We offer a view that confer-ring interactions in online/virtual spaces can support collegial, feminist and egalitarian sharing and knowledge exchange.},

  abstract = {What's the go of it? What's the particular go of it?James Clerk Maxwell, Physicist.This chapter aims to give you some idea about the world-wide scientific community and what makes it work. As the quote from Maxwell suggests, we will not be concentrating upon facts and figures, but upon the basic organisation of science, and its particular `go', the way it works.More than fifty years ago, the sociologist Robert K. Merton (1942) outlined a theory of how the scientific community works. Merton saw science as a self-regulating community of researchers, governed by a strong and distinctive ethos. This ethos involved the sharing of information, scepticism about results until evidence was produced, and a strong belief in the pursuit of truth. Merton was a shrewd observer of humanity, and was fully aware that many scientists pursue careers for their own self-interest. However, he argued, the ethos of science bound scientists to conform to the rules and expectations of science. In addition, scientists constantly scrutinised each other's work, ensuring that standards were maintained. Merton's ideal should be borne in mind as we investigate the scientific community.The first point to make is that science is a varied activity, even within one country, as Figure 2.1 illustrates. It is based on official Australian statistics, and shows three important things about science in this country. It shows where the largest amounts of money come from to support science, where that money goes, and where the scientists are.},

While some participants experienced exclusions, most participants described a conference that felt caring, welcoming and like `home'. Following this discussion, we interrogate the idea of the conference as `home', asking questions about the gendered division of `academic housekeeping' practices that underpin such home-making. Engaging with feminist theorising of emotional labour, we argue that academic women undertook significant, and often hidden, care and service labour to maintain a homely conference community.},

Postdocs are expected to move for short-term positions which can often be problematic for early-career researchers, especially those from under-represented groups in STEM. However, the proliferation of computational research has changed how scientists can conduct science, opening the door to postdoctoral work being conducted remotely. Research activities primarily involving quantitative analysis, modeling, writing, and data collection can take place anywhere and therefore can all be conducted on a remote or semi-remote basis. We offer 10 simple rules for overcoming challenges and leveraging the unique opportunities presented by remote postdoc positions, derived from our experiences as either remote postdocs or the PIs who have mentored them. We believe that not only will these suggestions increase the desirability of remote postdoc positions whenever they are feasible, but that they also contain good practices for facilitating better communication both within labs more generally and in other long-distance collaborations.},

  abstract = {In this article I explore how generic disability conferences can become more inclusive of participants with intellectual disability. Increased inclusivity entails adapting to the support needs of people with intellectual disability, in line with the principles and practice of inclusive research. In the article I consider three specific areas where there can be more inclusion \textendash{} access to information related to the conference, access to knowledge imparted during the conference, and financial issues. While many good practices have been developed in these areas, it is important to ensure that inclusion is catered for in a systematic and pro-active manner, so that people with intellectual disability have increasingly more meaningful and active roles within disability studies and disability research.},

This edited collection explores best practices for effective teaching and learning about various forms of systemic group privilege such as that based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, and class. Formatted in three easy-to-follow sections, Deconstructing Privilege charts the history of privilege studies and provides intersectional approaches to the topic.  Drawing on a wealth of research and real-life accounts, this book gives educators both the theoretical foundations they need to address issues of privilege in the classroom and practical ways to forge new paths for critical dialogues in educational settings. Combining interdisciplinary contributions from leading experts in the field-- such as Tim Wise and Abby Ferber-- with pedagogical strategies and tips for teaching about privilege, Deconstructing Privilege is an essential book for any educator who wants to address what privilege really means in the classroom.},

  abstract = {Studies of social difference have often focused on segregation and oppression, leaving out the `up -side of discrimination': privilege. Privilege is the unrecognised advantage positioning certain people in a favoured state and systematically conferring power on groups of people in specific contexts. Privilege is also situated: it accumulates in place. Building on processual understanding of space and place, the purpose of this paper is to add to our understanding of processes of privilege accumulation in place by exploring the relationship between privilege and place when both are considered processes rather than entities. Building on Doreen Massey's work (2005, 2011) for analysing an empirical case, Nordic Outdoor, the article shows that privilege can be understood as meshed in place: privilege accumulates in the same process of configuring trajectories that gives shape to the place in which privilege emerges. Mobilising the concept of place, trajectories and power geometries enables us to direct our attention to constructions of convergence. These concepts are thus not only helpful in studying privilege and power, but they also allow us to treat privilege accumulation as sociomaterial process, taking form locally as the throwntogetherness of a place is negotiated, but also related to many other places and times.},

In this article I will explore my own experience and insights about how conferences might be better organised; on the one hand to avoid losing the voices of disabled activists and scholars which Disability Studies needs to have practical impact, and on the other to create a new set of inclusive conference practices, going beyond accessibility attempts to `fit' disabled attendees into traditional lecture halls which are fundamentally not inclusive.},

We address this question by drawing on 175 interviews with those working in professional and managerial occupations, 36 of whom are from middle-class backgrounds but identify as working class or long-range upwardly mobile. Our findings indicate that this misidentification is rooted in a self-understanding built on particular `origin stories' which act to downplay interviewees' own, fairly privileged, upbringings and instead forge affinities to working-class extended family histories. Yet while this `intergenerational self' partially reflects the lived experience of multigenerational upward mobility, it also acts \textendash{} we argue \textendash{} as a means of deflecting and obscuring class privilege. By positioning themselves as ascending from humble origins, we show how these interviewees are able to tell an upward story of career success `against the odds' that simultaneously casts their progression as unusually meritocratically legitimate while erasing the structural privileges that have shaped key moments in their trajectory.},

  abstract = {Background Research on the effects of increasing workplace diversity has grown substantially. Unfortunately, little is focused on the healthcare industry, leaving organizations to make decisions based on conflicting findings regarding the association of diversity with quality and financial outcomes. To help improve the evidence-based research, this umbrella review summarizes diversity research specific to healthcare. We also look at studies focused on professional skills relevant to healthcare. The goal is to assess the association between diversity, innovation, patient health outcomes, and financial performance. Methods Medical and business research indices were searched for diversity studies published since 1999. Only meta-analyses and large-scale studies relating diversity to a financial or quality outcome were included. The research also had to include the healthcare industry or involve a related skill, such as innovation, communication and risk assessment. Results Most of the sixteen reviews matching inclusion criteria demonstrated positive associations between diversity, quality and financial performance. Healthcare studies showed patients generally fare better when care was provided by more diverse teams. Professional skills-focused studies generally find improvements to innovation, team communications and improved risk assessment. Financial performance also improved with increased diversity. A diversity-friendly environment was often identified as a key to avoiding frictions that come with change. Conclusions Diversity can help organizations improve both patient care quality and financial results. Return on investments in diversity can be maximized when guided deliberately by existing evidence. Future studies set in the healthcare industry, will help leaders better estimate diversity-related benefits in the context of improved health outcomes, productivity and revenue streams, as well as the most efficient paths to achieve these goals.},

In this framework, problem-solving agents possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers. Their relatively greater ability is more than offset by their lack of problem-solving diversity.},

  abstract = {The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) mandates the inclusion of individuals with disabilities to a broad range of facilities and public buildings. One overlooked area is access to conferences. Conferences are held in a range of buildings, including purpose-built venues, hotels, and stadia. Often, the focus is on access for people with mobility limitations, but access for people with other disabilities, such as vision or hearing loss, or mental ill-health, can be overlooked. This is a significant oversight since around 19\% of the population experience a disability (Brault, 2012): it makes sound business sense, as well as a sense of social justice, to ensure more people can access conferences. This article uses a literature review methodology to highlight key considerations to make conferences more accessible to a broad range of people with disabilities. A theoretical framework of Universal Design is proposed to support the ideas. A holistic approach is taken to inclusion, including online booking, transport, and parking, since, without these being accessible, the event becomes inaccessible. Other aspects considered include registration, seating, restrooms, catering, and communication aids. Creating accessible conferences can help promote equity and inclusion and bring people with diverse perspectives together to enrich a conference.},

  abstract = {Markets are central to modern society, so their failures can be devastating. Here, we examine a prominent failure: price bubbles. Bubbles emerge when traders err collectively in pricing, causing misfit between market prices and the true values of assets. The causes of such collective errors remain elusive. We propose that bubbles are affected by ethnic homogeneity in the market and can be thwarted by diversity. In homogenous markets, traders place undue confidence in the decisions of others. Less likely to scrutinize others' decisions, traders are more likely to accept prices that deviate from true values. To test this, we constructed experimental markets in Southeast Asia and North America, where participants traded stocks to earn money. We randomly assigned participants to ethnically homogeneous or diverse markets. We find a marked difference: Across markets and locations, market prices fit true values 58\% better in diverse markets. The effect is similar across sites, despite sizeable differences in culture and ethnic composition. Specifically, in homogenous markets, overpricing is higher as traders are more likely to accept speculative prices. Their pricing errors are more correlated than in diverse markets. In addition, when bubbles burst, homogenous markets crash more severely. The findings suggest that price bubbles arise not only from individual errors or financial conditions, but also from the social context of decision making. The evidence may inform public discussion on ethnic diversity: it may be beneficial not only for providing variety in perspectives and skills, but also because diversity facilitates friction that enhances deliberation and upends conformity.},

  abstract = {As the global health crisis unfolded, many academic conferences moved online in 2020. This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities.Yet, the mere existence of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully. In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals; the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design.Here, we draw from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences. Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.},

Most of the underlying mechanisms take place within firms, but only a handful of organization-level studies have been conducted. We contribute to this underexplored literature by using a unique sample of 7,600 firms to investigate links among cultural diversity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and sales strategies in London businesses between 2005 and 2007. London is one of the world's major cities, with a rich cultural diversity that is widely seen as a social and economic asset. Our data allowed us to distinguish owner/partner and wider workforce characteristics, identify migrant/minority-headed firms, and differentiate firms along multiple dimensions. The results, which are robust to most challenges, suggest a small but significant ``diversity bonus'' for all types of London firms. First, companies with diverse management are more likely to introduce new product innovations than are those with homogeneous ``top teams.'' Second, diversity is particularly important for reaching international markets and serving London's cosmopolitan population. Third, migrant status has positive links to entrepreneurship. Overall, the results provide some support for claims that diversity is an economic asset, as well as a social benefit.},

  abstract = {International conferences are an important component of the professional calendar of scientists and practitioners in many fields, and are valued as opportunities to establish, create and foster networks, wellbeing and knowledge. The 2020 global pandemic, in prohibiting large gatherings and travel, has provided an opportunity to test the feasibility and implications of a shift from in-person to online conference formats. Avoiding international travel and associated bureaucracy, time and expense could overcome many of the historic injustices preventing many from participating in and benefiting from international conferences, and also avoid the emissions associated with international air travel. However, prior to 2020, there has been resistance to moving these events online and a perception that the attributes for which conferences are valued cannot be cultivated online. Here, we use the example of the 6th International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC6), which moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore participants' perceptions and experiences of an online conference and the potential effects on access and inclusion. Our results show that moving online substantially increased the accessibility of the conference for those who would be unable to attend an in-person event for financial or personal reasons. Results also indicate that the online experience was able to recreate some of the benefits of in-person events, and that many participants are interested in attending online or virtual events in the future. However, the degree of enjoyment experienced or `value' perceived likely relates to the frame of reference of the individual participant and a commitment to actively engage in the programme. Reflecting on the success of IMCC6, we conclude that holding international conferences online, or at least including an online element as part of a `hybrid' model, is a significant improvement in the capacity of conferences to meet the moral imperatives of the conservation community by addressing the climate crisis and some of the systemic injustices within the field.},

I argue that we need further research into these highly charged spaces, and I contribute to this agenda by analyzing 17 accessibility policy documents produced by 8 different professional organizations. Using critical discourse analysis, I examine the choices these documents have made, both verbal and visual, as well as possible outcomes of these choices for various audiences. In closing, I offer a list of generative questions that the authors of such documents should consider. It is impossible for a policy document to ``imagine'' access perfectly ahead of time; rather, we should understand and treat policy documents as part of a continually evolving dialogue.},

  abstract = {In-person academic conferences are important to disseminate research and provide networking opportunities. Whether academics attend in-person conferences is based on the cost, accessibility, and safety of the event. Therefore, in-person conferences are less accessible to academics and stakeholders that are unable to overcome some of these factors, which then act as a barrier to equal and inclusive participation. Additionally, the carbon footprint of conference travel is increasingly becoming a factor in deciding on whether to attend a conference. Online conferences may provide opportunities to mitigate these challenges. Here, we illustrate how a learned society can move their conference online. Then, comparing data acquired from the virtual conference and previous in-person conferences, we explore the aids and barriers influencing the decision of delegates to attend the meetings. Ultimately, moving meetings online aids delegate participation by removing concerns about travel, cost, and carbon emissions, but there remains a barrier to participation as online meetings are perceived as less effective for networking and social opportunities.},

Virtual conferences may not fully replace in-person meetings, but they are rapidly becoming an accepted alternative format.

En este trabajo exploramos la participaci\'on de la mujer en las TICs aplicadas a la agricultura a trav\'es de un conjunto de datos de diez a\~nos del Congreso de Agroinform\'atica (2008-2018). Usando este conjunto de datos cuantificamos la participaci\'on de la mujer en distintos roles (autores, revisores, organizadores, moderadores y oradores invitados), seg\'un la instituci\'on de pertenencia y el origen~ geogr\'afico. Encontramos que el promedio de autoras mujeres es de 26\%, siendo el m\'aximo el 36,6\%. La proporci\'on de mujeres participando como primeras autoras en los trabajos nunca super\'o el 35\% en todos los a\~nos analizados. La participaci\'on de mujeres fue consistentemente menor en todos los a\~nos del congreso y para todos los roles, siendo estos hallazgos coincidentes con estudios similares de otros eventos y disciplinas. INTA y CONICET son las instituciones que m\'as aportan al congreso en cuanto a trabajos y participantes de ambos g\'eneros y la regi\'on pampeana presenta este rol en cuanto al enfoque geogr\'afico. Las acciones para aumentar la participaci\'on femenina ha dado resultados para aquellos roles que la organizaci\'on puede controlar (como los comit\'es cient\'ificos, organizador y los disertantes), pero sigue siendo necesario trabajar sobre el rol de autoras.},

The advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction, collaboration and networking, yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow. Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings' carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 200 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for key features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet. {$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}``\emph{They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself}.''{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textemdash{} \emph{Andy Warhol}{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The key challenges to online academic conferencing are identified as the digital divide, language proficiencies, ``academic tourism'' and the qualities of face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication (as encapsulated in the social presence theory and the media richness theory). The paper concludes with some challenges for future online conferences and remarks on the ongoing role and format of online academic conferences. Relevance to industry The lessons learnt in building and maintaining an online conference have a great deal of applicability to understanding how all online communities might be sustained. While some of the issues may appear ``unique'' to an academic environment (e.g. ``academic tourism''), the lessons learnt from CybErg with regard to internationalisation of discussion and the technological challenges faced in different regions of the world has direct relevance to international industries and the efficacy of online conferencing facilities that they use.},

Three key features affect conference attendance: demographic characteristics (background features and prior experiences that affect an academic's willingness and ability to attend), accessibility (constraints to attending, such as financing, family responsibilities, institutional support or teaching commitments) and purpose (the value placed on attending conferences by the individual, the institution, or the discipline). In particular, we identify differences for women, Indigenous people, and those born overseas with respect to their ability to navigate and their inclination to attend national and international conferences.},

  abstract = {Teaching and Studying Social Issues: Major Programs and Approaches focuses on many of the major innovations developed over the past 100 years by noted educators to assist students in the study and analysis of key social issues that impact their lives and society. This book complements earlier books that address other aspects of studying and addressing social issues in the secondary classroom: Researching and Teaching Social Issues: The Personal Stories and Pedagogical Efforts of Professors of Education (Lexington, Books, 2006); Addressing Social Issues in the Classroom and Beyond: The Pedagogical Efforts of Pioneers in the Field (Information Age Publishing, 2007); and Social Issues and Service at the Middle Level (Information Age Publishers, 2009). The current book ranges in scope from Harold Rugg's pioneering effort to develop textbooks that purposely addressed key social issues (and thus provided teachers and students with a major tool with which to examine social issues in the classroom) to the relatively new efforts over the last 20 to 30 years, including global education, environmental education, Science/Technology/Society (STS), and genocide education. This book provides the readers with details about the innovators their innovations so they can (1) learn from past efforts, particularly in regard to what worked and didn't work and why, (2) glean new ideas, methods and approaches for use in their own classrooms, and (3) craft new methods and approaches based on the strengths of past innovations.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated whether meeting electronically first using computer-mediated communication (CMC) before meeting face-to-face (FTF) increases the inclusion of a female group member in a predominantly male project team. Design/methodology/approach: We used an experimental design and a sample of 200 college students grouped within 50 four-person teams of one woman and three men. Twenty-five teams communicated using CMC first, then FTF. The other 25 teams communicated using FTF first, then CMC. Findings: Results showed that women felt more included in the teams when they used CMC first and then FTF as opposed to the more often recommended FTF and then CMC. Findings showed that the order of communication medium influenced perceived inclusion, which in turn influenced individual participation. Implications: Conventional wisdom suggests that today's project teams, whose members typically use a variety of communication media, should always meet FTF first at the beginning of their life cycle to enhance individual and team performance. Our study suggests that within diverse teams in which one minority team member is different from the rest of team and may feel excluded, initial CMC may help the minority member feel more included. Originality/value: This study shows that the order of communication medium can influence team outcomes. In particular, meeting using CMC first and then FTF can be helpful for diverse teams with minority team members.}

  year = {2002},
  publisher = {{Harvard Business Press}},
  abstract = {Today's marketplace is fueled by knowledge. Yet organizing systematically to leverage knowledge remains a challenge. Leading companies have discovered that technology is not enough, and that cultivating communities of practice is the keystone of an effective knowledge strategy.Communities of practice come together around common interests and expertise- whether they consist of first-line managers or customer service representatives, neurosurgeons or software programmers, city managers or home-improvement amateurs. They create, share, and apply knowledge within and across the boundaries of teams, business units, and even entire companies-providing a concrete path toward creating a true knowledge organization.In Cultivating Communities of Practice, Etienne Wenger, Richard McDermott, and William M. Snyder argue that while communities form naturally, organizations need to become more proactive and systematic about developing and integrating them into their strategy. This book provides practical models and methods for stewarding these communities to reach their full potential-without squelching the inner drive that makes them so valuable.Through in-depth cases from firms such as DaimlerChrysler, McKinsey \& Company, Shell, and the World Bank, the authors demonstrate how communities of practice can be leveraged to drive overall company strategy, generate new business opportunities, tie personal development to corporate goals, transfer best practices, and recruit and retain top talent. They define the unique features of these communities and outline principles for nurturing their essential elements. They provide guidelines to support communities of practice through their major stages of development, address the potential downsides of communities, and discuss the specific challenges of distributed communities. And they show how to recognize the value created by communities of practice and how to build a corporate knowledge strategy around them.Essential reading for any leader in today's knowledge economy, this is the definitive guide to developing communities of practice for the benefit-and long-term success-of organizations and the individuals who work in them.Etienne Wenger is a renowned expert and consultant on knowledge management and communities of practice in San Juan, California. Richard McDermott is a leading expert of organization and community development in Boulder, Colorado. William M. Snyder is a founding partner of Social Capital Group, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.},

  abstract = {Disability is an important and often overlooked component of diversity. Individuals with disabilities bring a rare perspective to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) because of their unique experiences approaching complex issues related to health and disability, navigating the healthcare system, creatively solving problems unfamiliar to many individuals without disabilities, managing time and resources that are limited by physical or mental constraints, and advocating for themselves and others in the disabled community. Yet, individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in STEMM. Professional organizations can address this underrepresentation by recruiting individuals with disabilities for leadership opportunities, easing financial burdens, providing equal access, fostering peer-mentor groups, and establishing a culture of equity and inclusion spanning all facets of diversity. We are a group of deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) engineers, scientists, and clinicians, most of whom are active in clinical practice and/or auditory research. We have worked within our professional societies to improve access and inclusion for D/HH individuals and others with disabilities. We describe how different models of disability inform our understanding of disability as a form of diversity. We address heterogeneity within disabled communities, including intersectionality between disability and other forms of diversity. We highlight how the Association for Research in Otolaryngology has supported our efforts to reduce ableism and promote access and inclusion for D/HH individuals. We also discuss future directions and challenges. The tools and approaches discussed here can be applied by other professional organizations to include individuals with all forms of diversity in STEMM.}

And, he answers the question: ``Is there anything we can do about it?'' by providing examples of behaviors that the reader can engage in to disengage the impact of their own biases. Originally published in 2014, the updated edition draws new examples from today's headlines such as the \#me too Movement, police shootings, and bias in the ever more partisan Trump era.},
