  abstract = {Previous efforts to evaluate the climate change impact of researchers have focused mainly on transport related impact of conference attendance, and infrastructure. Because these represent only a part of the activities involved in the science making process this short note presents the carbon footprint of a complete science making process of one specific case. Apart from presenting the total footprint, we evaluate the relative contribution of the different scientific activities, and quantify mitigating possibilities. The case PhD project had a carbon footprint of 21.5 t CO2-eq (2.69 t CO2-eq per peer-reviewed paper, 0.3 t CO2-eq per citation and 5.4 t CO2-eq per h-index unit at graduation) of which general mobility represents 75\%. Conference attendance was responsible for 35\% of the carbon footprint, whereas infrastructure related emissions showed to contribute 20\% of the total impact. Videoconferencing could have reduced the climate change impact on this case PhD with up to 44\%. Other emission reduction initiatives, such as using green electricity, reduction of energy consumption, and promoting commuting by bicycle, could have triggered a reduction of 14\% in this case study. This note fits in the movement of academics and universities willing to be green. The study confirms that researchers' mobility is the biggest contributor to his or her carbon footprint, but is not limited to conference attendance, showing the importance of considering all activities in the science making process.},

A substantial majority of postdocs are in a holding pattern, seeking tenure-track assistant professorships. We model the postdoc population as a labour force in waiting\textemdash in queue. Postdocs enter the queue as they start their first postdoctoral appointment, and they leave in one of two ways: (i) obtaining the `queue service' desired by the majority of postdocs, that is, an assistant professorship, or (2) reneging from the queue and seeking other positions. Using recent data from the US Survey of Doctorate Recipients, we show that the postdoc queue is one of those rare queueing systems where most of the queuers eventually renege rather than receive service. We find that only about 17\% of postdocs ultimately land tenure-track positions. The mean time in queue (postdoc career length) is 2.9 years, with significant variations across disciplines. We discuss policy implications. \textcopyright{} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background Better access for clinicians from low- and middle-income countries to international conferences can improve collaborative opportunities and subsequently address the knowledge gap between the weaker and stronger knowledge economies. A better understanding of the cost of international conferences may help conference organisers improve access to their conferences. This study aimed to describe the expense-associated barriers to a selection of international emergency medicine and critical care conferences, in terms of registration cost and out-of-pocket expense. Methods A cross sectional, retrospective design was used. Registration cost variables (cost, waivers, discounts and scholarships) were collected from a cohort of international emergency medicine and critical care conferences held during 2016. The World Health Organization Purchasing Power Parity index was then applied to calculate an equitable registration cost for delegates from South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, China, Australia, Germany and the United States for each conference. Results Twenty conferences were included. Eight conferences (36\%) offered discounted rates, and another eight offered scholarships for low- and middle-income country delegates. Calculated, equitable registration rates were 2.6, 1.9, 1.9, 1.7, 0.9, 1.1 times lower than quoted respectively for South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, China, Australia and Germany compared to the rate in United States dollar. Only one conference provided equitable registration rates for all test-countries. Discussion Current international conference registration costs (despite discounts, waivers and scholarships) are likely a barrier to including low- and middle-income delegates in the educational, networking and promotional opportunities that conferences provide. Conference organisers should consider restructuring registration costs to encourage more representative international audiences.},

Changes to funding structures, increased globalisation, marketisation and bureaucratisation of higher education have resulted in a performance-driven working environment where teaching workload and pressures to publish are further intensified due to excellence exercises in teaching and research. The result is low morale and an ever-rising number of reported mental health issues, burnout and stress-related illnesses within academia. This article explores some of these issues in the context of higher education institutions in the United Kingdom.

  abstract = {Postdoctoral positions are temporary full-time positions typically taken between completion of a PhD and the start of a permanent position. Postdocs are expected to move for short-term positions which can often be problematic for early-career researchers, especially those from under-represented groups in STEM. However, the proliferation of computational research has changed how scientists can conduct science, opening the door to postdoctoral work being conducted remotely. Research activities primarily involving quantitative analysis, modeling, writing, and data collection can take place anywhere and therefore can all be conducted on a remote or semi-remote basis. We offer 10 simple rules for overcoming challenges and leveraging the unique opportunities presented by remote postdoc positions, derived from our experiences as either remote postdocs or the PIs who have mentored them. We believe that not only will these suggestions increase the desirability of remote postdoc positions whenever they are feasible, but that they also contain good practices for facilitating better communication both within labs more generally and in other long-distance collaborations.},

In this article I will explore my own experience and insights about how conferences might be better organised; on the one hand to avoid losing the voices of disabled activists and scholars which Disability Studies needs to have practical impact, and on the other to create a new set of inclusive conference practices, going beyond accessibility attempts to `fit' disabled attendees into traditional lecture halls which are fundamentally not inclusive.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general framework for modeling functionally diverse problem-solving agents. In this framework, problem-solving agents possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers. Their relatively greater ability is more than offset by their lack of problem-solving diversity.},

  abstract = {The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) mandates the inclusion of individuals with disabilities to a broad range of facilities and public buildings. One overlooked area is access to conferences. Conferences are held in a range of buildings, including purpose-built venues, hotels, and stadia. Often, the focus is on access for people with mobility limitations, but access for people with other disabilities, such as vision or hearing loss, or mental ill-health, can be overlooked. This is a significant oversight since around 19\% of the population experience a disability (Brault, 2012): it makes sound business sense, as well as a sense of social justice, to ensure more people can access conferences. This article uses a literature review methodology to highlight key considerations to make conferences more accessible to a broad range of people with disabilities. A theoretical framework of Universal Design is proposed to support the ideas. A holistic approach is taken to inclusion, including online booking, transport, and parking, since, without these being accessible, the event becomes inaccessible. Other aspects considered include registration, seating, restrooms, catering, and communication aids. Creating accessible conferences can help promote equity and inclusion and bring people with diverse perspectives together to enrich a conference.},

  abstract = {Markets are central to modern society, so their failures can be devastating. Here, we examine a prominent failure: price bubbles. Bubbles emerge when traders err collectively in pricing, causing misfit between market prices and the true values of assets. The causes of such collective errors remain elusive. We propose that bubbles are affected by ethnic homogeneity in the market and can be thwarted by diversity. In homogenous markets, traders place undue confidence in the decisions of others. Less likely to scrutinize others' decisions, traders are more likely to accept prices that deviate from true values. To test this, we constructed experimental markets in Southeast Asia and North America, where participants traded stocks to earn money. We randomly assigned participants to ethnically homogeneous or diverse markets. We find a marked difference: Across markets and locations, market prices fit true values 58\% better in diverse markets. The effect is similar across sites, despite sizeable differences in culture and ethnic composition. Specifically, in homogenous markets, overpricing is higher as traders are more likely to accept speculative prices. Their pricing errors are more correlated than in diverse markets. In addition, when bubbles burst, homogenous markets crash more severely. The findings suggest that price bubbles arise not only from individual errors or financial conditions, but also from the social context of decision making. The evidence may inform public discussion on ethnic diversity: it may be beneficial not only for providing variety in perspectives and skills, but also because diversity facilitates friction that enhances deliberation and upends conformity.},

  abstract = {International conferences are an important component of the professional calendar of scientists and practitioners in many fields, and are valued as opportunities to establish, create and foster networks, wellbeing and knowledge. The 2020 global pandemic, in prohibiting large gatherings and travel, has provided an opportunity to test the feasibility and implications of a shift from in-person to online conference formats. Avoiding international travel and associated bureaucracy, time and expense could overcome many of the historic injustices preventing many from participating in and benefiting from international conferences, and also avoid the emissions associated with international air travel. However, prior to 2020, there has been resistance to moving these events online and a perception that the attributes for which conferences are valued cannot be cultivated online. Here, we use the example of the 6th International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC6), which moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore participants' perceptions and experiences of an online conference and the potential effects on access and inclusion. Our results show that moving online substantially increased the accessibility of the conference for those who would be unable to attend an in-person event for financial or personal reasons. Results also indicate that the online experience was able to recreate some of the benefits of in-person events, and that many participants are interested in attending online or virtual events in the future. However, the degree of enjoyment experienced or `value' perceived likely relates to the frame of reference of the individual participant and a commitment to actively engage in the programme. Reflecting on the success of IMCC6, we conclude that holding international conferences online, or at least including an online element as part of a `hybrid' model, is a significant improvement in the capacity of conferences to meet the moral imperatives of the conservation community by addressing the climate crisis and some of the systemic injustices within the field.},

Using critical discourse analysis, I examine the choices these documents have made, both verbal and visual, as well as possible outcomes of these choices for various audiences. In closing, I offer a list of generative questions that the authors of such documents should consider. It is impossible for a policy document to ``imagine'' access perfectly ahead of time; rather, we should understand and treat policy documents as part of a continually evolving dialogue.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Scientific conferences provide valuable opportunities for researchers across career stages and disciplines to present their latest work and to network with their peers. The advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction, collaboration and networking, yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow. Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings' carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 200 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for key features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet. {$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}``\emph{They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself}.''{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textemdash{} \emph{Andy Warhol}{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Diversity enhances innovation in biomedical sciences and, as it relates to novel findings and treatment of diverse populations, in the field of infectious diseases. There are many obstacles to achieving diversity in the biomedical workforce, which create challenges at the levels of recruitment, retention, education, and promotion of individuals. Here we present the challenges, opportunities, and suggestions for the field, institutions, and individuals to adopt in mitigating bias and achieving greater levels of equity, representation, and excellence in clinical practice and research. Our findings provide optimism for a bright future of fair and collaborative approaches that will enhance the power of our biomedical workforce.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the enablers and inhibitors of participation in an online academic conference series. Using CybErg as an example of an online academic conference, the lessons and experiences learnt at all three of the previous CybErg conferences and the organisation of the last two of these conferences are shared in this paper. The key challenges to online academic conferencing are identified as the digital divide, language proficiencies, ``academic tourism'' and the qualities of face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication (as encapsulated in the social presence theory and the media richness theory). The paper concludes with some challenges for future online conferences and remarks on the ongoing role and format of online academic conferences. Relevance to industry The lessons learnt in building and maintaining an online conference have a great deal of applicability to understanding how all online communities might be sustained. While some of the issues may appear ``unique'' to an academic environment (e.g. ``academic tourism''), the lessons learnt from CybErg with regard to internationalisation of discussion and the technological challenges faced in different regions of the world has direct relevance to international industries and the efficacy of online conferencing facilities that they use.},

  abstract = {Drawing on data collected in a cross-disciplinary survey of early-career academics (ECAs) in New Zealand, this article explores the factors influencing ECA conference attendance. Our conceptual framework uses conference attendance as the dependent variable and measures gender, ethnicity, family responsibilities and workload. Three key features affect conference attendance: demographic characteristics (background features and prior experiences that affect an academic's willingness and ability to attend), accessibility (constraints to attending, such as financing, family responsibilities, institutional support or teaching commitments) and purpose (the value placed on attending conferences by the individual, the institution, or the discipline). In particular, we identify differences for women, Indigenous people, and those born overseas with respect to their ability to navigate and their inclination to attend national and international conferences.},
