\section*{Abstract (optional from what I've seen)}

In July 2021, the authors of this article, along with a larger group of people, organized a global and virtual conference for users and developers of the R software, useR! 2021. useR! conferences are strictly non-profit and are organized by volunteers from the R community and supported by the R Foundation. These global meetings include attendees from both academia and the industry. This year, we aimed at building a high-quality conference in a kind, inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment for everyone. In this article, we share a few critical lessons learned during the past year's work organizing this conference. We highlight these as the 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference. These rules apply equally to academic, industry, or mixed conferences; the rules are inspired by a global experience but can also be easily adapted and applied to regional or local conferences.

\section*{Introduction}

Conferences are spaces to meet and reconnect with members from a specific community, learn about new advances in the field and share our recent contributions. The larger the conference, the larger the opportunities to network and learn from your cohort. However, just like in science and academia in general, conferences can become an exclusive space for privileged groups (e.g., white, male, from a rich country, English-native speaker, with no physical disabilities)  \cite{arend_disparity_2019, timperley_he_2020, gewin_what_2019, brown_ableism_2018}.

Calls to improve diversity in many academic spaces, including conferences, are becoming frequent as communities and scientific societies are called out for overrepresenting specific groups of people. While these systematic issues are beginning to be addressed, there is scope for much improvement all around.

Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions: age, body ability, career stage, gender, gender identity,  geographic origin, language, neurodiversity, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic background, to name a few. There are implicit hierarchies along these axes, and some statuses (e.g., being cisgender, white, male, from the US or Europe) hold the privilege of being the default settings for which all systems are consciously and unconsciously built. Thinking about diversity and inclusion is thinking about counteracting the structures that hold these hierarchies in place.

%some groups face discrimination and might be underrepresented in your community and event \cite{timperley_he_2020}

This article suggests rules for pivoting traditional conferences towards inclusiveness and diversity and welcoming minoritized groups. These tips stem from the authors' experience in organizing a global and virtual conference for users and developers of the R programming language, useR! 2021. We aimed at building a high-quality conference not just in terms of technical content but embracing everyone in a kind, inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment, critical in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the authors also have experience organizing other regional and national academic conferences and events in communities of practice such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries. Here, we share the lessons learned within the past year of organizing this global useR conference, summarized as 10 simple rules towards an inclusive conference.

\section*{Rule 1: Set realistic but bold diversity indicators}
.
As a starting point, identify which groups are usually unsupported or discriminated against in the community or event of interest, and determine the contributing factors. Next, set measurable indicators of success when organizing a diverse conference. The numbers resulting from these indicators are not the primary goal, and this is not about performative allyship. Instead, these numbers should guide and help hold the organizing team accountable towards these diverse and inclusive goals.

We found it greatly helpful to publish a diversity statement (e.g., \url{https://user2021.r-project.org/about/diversity_statement/}) and express this welcoming spirit in your communication strategy (social networks, website, brand, and visual identity) and in every decision you make, will let people know that they are seen, respected, and welcomed, and that this is their space and community too. However, it is important to not stop with a statement alone, but identify specific goals and tasks that ensure compliance with these larger goals, for e.g., identifying accessible platforms, developing a detailed code of conduct, and accessibility guidelines (see other Rules below).


\section*{Rule 2: Have an inclusive and diverse organizing team}
A genuinely inclusive conference can only be organized by an inclusive and diverse organizing team. Build a team with people from different regions, genders, socioeconomic statuses, and other aspects of diversity. Particular attention should be paid to the usually underrepresented groups (see \textbf{Rule 1} discussing the dimensions of diversity lacking in your community and event). To ensure a deeper understanding of the challenges in different diverse groups, it is essential to create a representative working group that functions as a snapshot of the community at large. Even if creating and maintaining such an interdisciplinary team is challenging, the positive outcomes far outweigh any minor inconveniences, and the team will grow, learn, and embrace more inclusive practices. For instance, if the organizing team is global and remote, time zones can be hard to manage, with meetings scheduled at odd hours. The team may also have to review carefully and teach themselves the correct vocabulary for internal and external communication and identify the best platforms to mechanisms to account for every culture and situation. 
A successful well-oiled inclusive team will provide a safe space for everyone not just to learn and grow but identify critical aspects that are working or failing to improve inclusiveness and accessibility together \cite{hong_groups_2004}.

\section*{Rule 3: Finding the best people for each task}

While this rule may seem intuitive, one would be surprised by how often conference organizers tend to do everything themselves instead of reaching out to the right people for the right task -- likely because the latter involves careful planning and communication well ahead of time or because they naively overestimate their expertise in areas they lack practical experience in. For e.g., a cisgender or non-neurodiverse person estimating what might work best for the LGBTQ+ or people with hearing and seeing difficulty. 
Therefore, to build your team of organizers for the conference, you need to actively seek out and recruit the best people for each task, akin to filling your team with the best, diversified portfolio. However, the intention to put together a diverse team alone is not enough. One needs to look for, reach out to, invite, encourage, and onboard these people until there is ample representation across the diversity spectrum and dimensions [\textbf{Fig. 1}]. To achieve this, it will be necessary to go beyond one's limited networks when inviting people to the organizing team, keynote speakers, program committee, session chairs, reviewers, and others. Ensuring diversity in each of these teams and panels is a deliberate process -- if there is not much diversity in the first set of names, it needs to be revised to include people from minoritized groups. If these groups aren't showing up in the A-list, it is seldom because of their technical acumen -- it is because we, as organizers, are not used to turning every work and looking in unfamiliar places to bring in the talent.  Many of our biased lists are products of the existing systems that have always privileged some groups of people \cite{dwyer_notice_2021, sarabipour_evaluating_2020}, thus encouraging us to look further to find great people that are not routinely in the spotlight. We need to go beyond our narrow and often limited networks. So, as long as we start with an inclusive and diverse organizing team (\textbf{Rule 2}), we can aim at finding the right people for various aspects of the conference organization. The regional and local communities are also good sources to tap into. For example, for useR! 2021, groups like AfricaR, R-Ladies, MiR, R Forwards, and LatinR were fundamental to reach people for the organizing team, potential attendees, and sponsors.


\section*{Rule 4: Set registration rates commensurate with the registrant's cost of living}

Conferences, even virtual ones, should have registration fees for two primary reasons. The first one is that preparing the conference involves a lot of concerted effort and costs money (e.g., commercial registration tools, captioning, or conference venue, if in-person) and this translates to the participation fee. The second reason has to do with the human psychology -- people value more the things they pay for, and there is a lower attendance rate for free events with registration /cite{eventbrite_ultimate_2017}[any publication to back this up?]. On the other hand, if we are aiming for inclusiveness and representation, the socioeconomic context of participants should be taken into account when determining the registration rates. Usually, there is a higher fee for people from the industry than for academia (~ proportionate to income). We should also consider a lower fee for non-profit organizations, government employees, or freelancers, and use conversion factors (for country of residence using data from International Comparison Program report of the World Bank \cite{arend_disparity_2019}). It is important to include discounts for students as well as for postdocs (early career trainees) to encourage their participation \cite{sarabipour_evaluating_2020, andalib_postdoc_2018, kaplan_postdoc_2012}. Since postdoc (or trainee) statuses are not always well-defined in academia and can vary for each country, their payment category should be explicitly defined. Disabilities may also increase the overall cost of conferences, especially in-person \cite{de_picker_rethinking_2020, irish_increasing_2020}; discounts would help reduce the financial burden for these factions too.

Representation is an important aspect of diversity and inclusivity: see people like you, from your country, that speak your language is one of the best way to feel you belong, this is way the rates can not only being different for registration, but also, for sponsors, this allows us to have institutions and companies from all over the world being part of the conference which also means they will communicate about our event in their local communities.


\section*{Rule 5: Do not give scholarships or grants to attend. Give fee waivers or discounts without tedious application forms.}

Offering scholarships or grants to attend the conference may be counterproductive, as they can be seen as more of a competition and attract people that might not need the money (e.g., when their PI could pay for it) but could apply for it to enrich their CV while filtering out people who do not feel entitled to earn them. If the goal is to help the people in need, the language needs to make that clear without shrouding it with fancy-sounding phrases. Ultimately, it is a fee waiver or a discount for the people who need additional financial support. Also, the process for applicants should be simplified. People with limited resources already have a hard time applying for loans, grants, and scholarships all their lives. We should not make the attendees' lives more challenging by asking for long essays to convince us that they deserve our support. \st{Many people that cannot afford international conferences do not even try to apply for waivers/scholarships because they are discouraged by the requirements, the process, and partly because they believe it would be hard for them to win financial/travel aid.} For this stage of the process, a certain degree of trust goes a long way -- when they say they need the support, it is best to give them the waiver rather than second guess their eligibility. Also, the participant metadata (e.g., demographics, gender, career stage) is already a strong indicator of their potential need for aid.
If the conference resources allow it, the organizers could even take further steps to offer financial support for activities that help them have the time and resources to be at the conference: child care support, transportation fees (if in-person), or internet connection services (if virtual). 

\section*{Rule 6: Make the conference accessible to all, from start to end}

Conferences are usually inaccessible to people with hearing, visual, and other disabilities \cite{price_access_2009}. Each of these groups should be considered at every stage of the planning process. Welcoming representatives from these groups into the organizing team would allow them to take part in the decisions from the beginning and spot right away the inaccessible practices that need to improve (see \textbf{Rule 2}). If the conference is in person, the venue must be accessible for people with mobility limitations. A quiet space for neurodivergent people and a space for breastfeeding should also be provided. Images used in communications about the conference should be accompanied by alternative text and videos with captions and sound. Platforms for conference registration, abstract submission -- and chat platforms, if the conference is virtual or hybrid -- should be screen-reader friendly and with low technology requirements (that do not have compatible hardware, software, and internet connection requirements to function, all this tested beforehand). Captioning for presentations should be available in more than one language if possible. If the conference is in-person, presenters should speak into a microphone to make it easier for captioners or interpreters to listen to them. Accessibility guidelines for slides and presentations should be provided to the presenters, and their use should be encouraged (see \url{https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/accessibility/} for example). Among other things, the speakers should provide raw and accessible material to their talks before the conference, e.g., such as RMarkdown, HTML, or TeX files; if they prerecord their presentation, they should include their video and ensure that their face is visible so that deaf and hard-of-hearing people can read their lips if needed. Accessibility awards at the end of the conference are an excellent way to acknowledge the speakers who were mindful of inclusiveness when preparing and delivering their talks. 

Accessibility practices are not afterthoughts that can be dealt with at the last minute. They require time and early decision-making \cite{irish_increasing_2020}. Conversely, inaccessible decisions are hard to course-correct, e.g., when finding out too late that a venue is inaccessible for wheelchairs in an in-person conference. 
Bear in mind that most accessibility practices are beneficial to everyone. Captions, for instance, are used by non-native speakers and people that access the conference in loud environments. The prior availability of material benefits people with low bandwidth and non-native speakers as well.


\section*{Rule 7: Take deliberate efforts to promote the conference among underrepresented groups}

If some minoritized groups are underrepresented in the conference, they may not feel like they belong. 
If part of the community has been historically discriminated against, one should emphasize that they are particularly welcome in this event and that the organization will make it a safe and inclusive environment. 
An effort must be made to promote the conference as welcoming and supportive for those without the necessary 'credentials' or resources. For the latter, fee waivers, financial support, and ease of application/registration should be advertised. People who are used to applying and getting rejected for scholarships and waivers may find it relieving that the process will be supportive rather than discriminatory against underrepresented groups. Providing financial and other support (e.g., childcare, flexible hours) will help minoritized groups partake more willingly in the organization and the actual conference.
%ast likewise, some key people in your organizing team might not be able to collaborate without remuneration. Resources permitting, it may be a good idea to secure funds to offer stipends to them.

\section*{Rule 8: Have an important online component of the conference} 

In-person interaction is priceless; however, it is more expensive for some, even unattainable for others \cite{arend_disparity_2019, timperley_he_2020, niner_better_2021}. This inaccessibility is particularly true for global conferences that usually take place in high-income countries, making it financially demanding for international participants and often impossible to attend due to immigration requirements \cite{sarabipour_evaluating_2020, gewin_what_2019}. Online conferences are more inclusive and do not need a visa or a big budget.

Alternatively, a conference could have a hybrid format with an in-person and online component. This dual format could allow a group of people to interact face-to-face while providing many others the opportunity to participate remotely. The challenge in this kind of setting would be to make the online component equally relevant as the in-person component and not just a consolation prize to the less privileged in the community \cite{niner_better_2021}. 

\section*{Rule 9: Don't let language restrict high-quality participation}

In international conferences, English is often the official language. Submissions, presentations, tutorials, and workshops are in English. The platforms, the webpage, and official communications are also in English. While English is the primary language in scientific communication and one official language makes it conducive to communicate widely, opening up the conference to other languages could make it less intimidating to people who are not fluent in English \cite{niner_better_2021}. Excluding them may potentially lead to missing innovative contributions brought about by a language barrier. Advertising the conference in several languages and considering having non-English workshops and presentations (with or without captions in English) could help overcome this barrier. For instance, hosting one international day/session per conference might be a great place to start!

\section*{Rule 10: Have a code of conduct and a team to reinforce it}

To ensure an inclusive, friendly, and safe space in the conference, the organizers need to a clearly define the code of conduct and a team to enforce it \cite{favaro_your_2016}. `The purpose of a code of conduct is to protect members of a community from harm in that community's spaces. The people who need the protection of a code of conduct are usually those with less power or privilege, as more powerful or privileged people are often already protected from most harm.' \cite{aurora_how_2018}
The code of conduct should be displayed prominently in several spaces of the conference to deter people from incurring in unaccepted behavior.

The code of conduct team should receive training to understand unambiguously what to and not to enforce in a code of conduct, how to receive reports, respond to incidents, and communicate their responses. A diverse code of conduct team will be more understanding of intersectionality issues in discrimination and harassment practices. 



\section*{Concluding remarks}

The ten rules stated here can be adapted depending on the conference format and settings. From our own experience, we are aware that enforcing these rules requires a tremendous amount of work and is not compensated financially or otherwise. However, the rewards from these suggested best practices will provide a healthier, stronger, and more inclusive community, empowering historically marginalized people and learning from them, thereby increasing the overall quality of the conference. Also, since these are early days and accessibility is not as widespread as it should be, the process might seem exacting. Hopefully, if more conferences and domains employ these techniques, the process will get more streamlined, straightforward, and mainstream to adapt with minimal overhead. After all, the strength of any community lies in its ability to be adaptive, inclusive, and accessible.
