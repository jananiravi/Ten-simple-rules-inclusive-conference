\section*{Abstract (optional from what I've seen)}

The authors of this article participated in the organization team of the annual user conference of the R Project for Statistical Computing, held in July 2021. useR! conferences are non-profit events, organized by volunteers from the R community and arranged by the R Foundation. The conference attracts a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the non-profit sector. For 2021, we aimed to build a high-quality virtual and explicitly global conference in a kind, inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment for everyone. 
In this article, we share a few lessons learned in the process. We streamline our most important learnings in 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference. These rules apply equally to academic, industry, or mixed conferences; the rules are inspired by a global experience but also apply at the regional or local level.

%andrea: matt's original sentence: reaching users and developers of the R language from more than 120 countries. 

%natalia: I changed the 1st sentence because we participated in the organizing team not just during the conference, but for several months before it. That was needed to work towards an inclusive conference

\section*{Introduction}

Conferences are spaces to meet and reconnect with members from a specific community, learn about advances in the field, and share our recent contributions. The larger the conference, the larger the opportunities to network and learn from your cohort. However, conferences can become discriminating spaces, in which members of some specific privileged groups (e.g., white, male, from a rich country, English-native speaker, with no physical disabilities) reproduce the systematic inequalities that occur in academia and society \cite{arendDisparityConferenceRegistration2019, timperleyHeMoanaPukepuke2020, gewinWhatScientistsShould2019, brownAbleismAcademiaWhere2018}.

While there has been some action to address systematic inequalities [where], there is still a lot of room for improvement.
% Rocío: Somehow this part below should be linked to the systemic inequalities part
Each one of us can have different points of view and experiences regarding inequality, depending on where we come from.
If you are reading this, you may be here because you already have some experience in Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility practices. Or you may want to improve diversity in your conference but do not know how or where to start. This article does not intend to be a comprehensive review of this topic --this would be impossible-- but will give some ideas pointing in key directions.   %Rocío: And finish with something more specific to connect with the next paragraph.

This article suggests rules to pivot traditional conferences towards inclusiveness and diversity. It is directed as people who are part of a stable meetings committee that oversees the site/location selection process or that coordinates with the local organizers (e.g. R Foundation Conference Committee, Ecological Society of America Meetings Committee). It is also directed at the local/virtual organizers who desire to make an inclusive conference starting at the planning stage. 

These tips stem from the authors' experience of organizing useR! 2021, a virtual and global conference for users and developers of the R programming language \cite{r_core_team_2021}. We embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and making it a kind, truly inclusive and accessible experience for everyone. Most of the authors also have experience of organizing other regional and national academic conferences and events in communities of practice such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries. Here, we share the lessons learned within the past year of organizing this global useR!2021, summarized as 10 simple rules towards an inclusive conference.

\section{Define what diversity and inclusion mean for your conference}
\label{rule_diversity}

Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions: age, physical ability, career stage, gender, gender identity,  geographic origin, language, neurodiversity, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic background, to name a few. Human diversity should be celebrated and respected in every way. Nonetheless, there are implicit hierarchies along these axes, and some statuses (e.g., cisgender, white, male, from the US or Europe) hold the privilege of being the default settings for which all systems --including conferences-- are consciously and unconsciously built. While no isolated initiative can change reality by itself, building a more diverse and inclusive conference starts by recognizing that these inequalities have excluded systematically whole groups of people from academia and from scientific and professional circles \cite{timperleyHeMoanaPukepuke2020}. 

Depending on the field, scientific or professional communities can have very different compositions. Thinking about which subgroups have been historically underrepresented in your community, and thinking about which subgroups hold most privileges can help you guide the organization of a more inclusive and diverse event. Doing this exercise while you ...
Think about the reasons why you want to create a more diverse conference can avoid falling into the mistake of treating diversity as a checklist, or using diversity and inclusion work for image purposes., and do not act as a benefactor or savior but as a genuine collaborator.
%andrea: this is here because we want to avoid readers to read as recipes and treat this less seriously than how it should (and then blaming the recipe). i am not sure of the phrasing or position in the text."genuine collaborator" is in the spirit of co-liberation/co-conspirator
Actively be an ally: if you understand your own privileges (unearned advantages given by society to some people but not all) \cite{}, you can help to work on end oppression in your conference. Privilege is largely invisible to those who have it. Once we understand our own privileges, we can begin addressing it on an individual and institutional basis.
%Natalia: I'll look for a reference for privilege definition.
%marcela: I modified the paragraph a bit, but it needs more work to connect Natalia's and Andrea's ideas. It's just a suggestion, feel free to re-write it again.
%Batool: I tried making some paraphrasing - It's just a simple suggestion, not sure if it deliver the message you mean it.  I also think that we may need to define "Privilege" at the 1st mention in the 1st paragraph in this rule. Something like "Privilege is a set of unearned benefits enjoyed by a group, beyond what’s available to others."

Think about the groups that are usually unsupported or discriminated against in your community or event, and about the meaning of "diverse" in your context. Imagine the result you would like to see if you succeeded in organizing a diverse conference according to your vision. Would this translate into an even gender distribution in your speakers? Would it be representation of all races -especially Black people-- among the head organizers, speakers, and attendees? Would it be having LGBTQIA+ friendly-spaces or community participation from key geographic regions? This vision should guide and help hold the organizing team accountable along the way.


%batool: There are a few references which define privilege and might be good to add here including: Friedman, S., O’Brien, D., & McDonald, I. (2021). Deflecting Privilege: Class Identity and the Intergenerational Self. Sociology, 55(4), 716–733. https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038520982225
%batool: Another one is: Crevani, L. (2019). Privilege in place: How organisational practices contribute to meshing privilege in place. Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35(2). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scaman.2018.09.002
%batool: please note that I didn't read both entire papers I mentioned above.




\section{Create a safe and welcoming environment}
\label{rule_inclusion}

While it is essential to improve representation towards some of the most visible dimensions of human diversity, such as race, gender, and country of origin, building a truly inclusive environment means taking care of all the other aspects of diversity as well. Having consideration of religious practices, setting specific accommodations for breastfeeding and child care, having LGBTIQA+-friendly spaces, creating community-only spaces, enforcing the use of pronouns, and treating gender as a non-binary variable are just some examples of decisions that can make inclusion real. Intersectionality also needs to be taken into account, to address multiple inequalities and barriers to unprivileged people that intersect and interact with each other \cite{crenshaw1989}. Importantly, you can take active steps in creating a more welcoming environment without requiring anyone to disclose personal information.

Paying attention to some dimensions of diversity while neglecting others may have unintended consequences. Lack of representation, unwelcoming --or overtly aggressive-- environments hinder participation (or future participation) of people who could otherwise become active community members. In severe cases, they can divert career paths, affect lives, and exclude people from some fields. %Rocío: it would be nice to have reference here.
%Adithi: Assist newbies of the conference navigate through the conference as they might feel overwhelmed attending a conference.

Nevertheless, having a diverse offer of networking opportunities that can appeal to people with different backgrounds, accessibility needs, and preferences can be challenging, especially if you have the mindset of organizing each activity for the complete pool of  attendants. If you think of smaller activities that can reach specific groups, preferably co-lead by community leaders, this sessions can be more productive and successful, and even inclusive, than trying to organize one single activity that can please the whole community. Some examples are the newbies sessions for first timers, mixers lead by R-Ladies or MiR, or a leisure activity that reunites subgroups with the same interests: arts, exercise, sports, movies, etc.

Adopting a code of conduct and creating a team to enforce it are key aspects in creating a safe environment during a conference \cite{favaroYourScienceConference2016}. The code of conduct is a document meant to keep the community safe and should state clearly: the unacceptable behaviors, the spaces of the conference in which it applies, the consequences for engaging in unacceptable behavior, and the way to report violations \cite{aurora2019}. 
The code of conduct should be displayed prominently in several spaces of the conference to deter people from unacceptable behavior, which includes microaggression. An efficient code of conduct acts as a protection for the community because the people who are the target of unacceptable behavior tend to be the ones with less power or privilege.

The code of conduct team should receive training on how to receive reports, respond to incidents, and communicate their responses. A diverse code of conduct team will be more understanding of power dynamics and sensitive to discrimination and harassment issues. There are also disciplinary cultures and geographical considerations that may need to be considered when developing and communicating the code of conduct (CoC). We strongly recommend reading “How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports” \cite{aurora2019} as an excellent starting point for the Code of Conduct team work. A Code of Conduct response committee needs to be trained and prepared in advance on how to decide on the incident reports. 

%Natalia: the book is by Aurora and Gardiner (2019), I corrected the title and added the reference including the link

%Some teams gather this vision in a diversity statement (e.g., \url{https://user2021.r-project.org/about/diversity_statement/}) to express the values of the conference and make diversity part of the outreach and communication strategy see Rule \ref{rule_communication}. However, it is important to not stop with a statement alone, but to identify specific goals and tasks that ensure compliance with these broader goals, for example, identifying accessible platforms, developing a detailed code of conduct and a team to enforce it, and preparing accessibility guidelines (see other Rules below).

\section{Have an inclusive and diverse organizing team}
\label{rule_organizing_team}

A genuinely inclusive conference can only be organized by an inclusive and diverse organizing team. Build a team with people from different regions, genders, socioeconomic statuses, and other aspects of diversity. Particular attention should be paid to the usually marginalized groups (see \textbf{Rule \ref{rule_diversity}} discussing the dimensions of diversity lacking in your community and event). To ensure a deeper understanding and smooth communication with different diverse groups, it is essential to create a representative working group that functions as a snapshot of the community at large. If you already have an organizing team, check for biases in its composition. 

%liz: please check if this paragraph connects well with the whole rule. i am using nothing about us without us but also talking about all marginalized groups, in the context of building a team. att: andrea

Gathering a diverse team will only work if there is real inclusion. People with disabilities often say: "Nothing about us without us"; the same holds for other dimensions of diversity. This means that the actual life experiences, expertise, and insights from people in marginalized groups are not replaceable with good intentions from people outside these groups. A truly inclusive and welcoming space is one in which everyone in the team is invited and allowed to bring their experience to bear. So, if you plan to organize something related to any community, region, or specific dimension of diversity, involve people from these groups. 

Creating and maintaining such a team and space may seem more challenging than working in homogeneous teams, but the positive outcomes far outweigh any inconveniences. 
Having diverse people in decision-making positions will affect positively all the other aspects of your conference because all the processes will benefit from their input, expertise, and distinct perspectives \cite{hongGroupsDiverseProblem2004}. On the other hand, a diverse team plays an important role at creating a welcoming space because seeing people with similar life experiences occupy public spaces, positions of power, and breaking negative stereotypes (i.e., representation) matters (see Rule \ref{rule_inclusion}). This is specially important for networking spaces, where receiving ideas, direct feedback, and spaces to co-lead from a wide variety of community members can be the key to organize meaningful sessions for all the conferences attendees. This gave a sense of variety and an appeal of “at least one networking session for everyone”. 

%Representation is an important aspect of diversity and inclusion: seeing people like you, from your country, that speak your language is one of the best way to feel you belong

Most advice when working with a diverse team should apply to every team, but is especially true when working with people from marginalized groups. First, delegate. Don't expect self-nomination and voting to work as mechanisms to counteract systemic inequalities. Nominate directly and offer coordinating positions, even if this means stepping down. Offer mentorship and guidance if you encounter cases of impostor syndrome, doubts about the use of English in communication (See Rule \ref{rule_language}), or others. Break the expectations about leadership as a lonely task and create smaller, co-led groups, where everyone finds their preferred tasks and gets to take leadership. Splitting the workload and responsibilities should not be done by putting care-taking labors --community building, meeting organization and note taking, conversations with potential partners-- on the hands of women and other minoritized groups, while men take the lead in stereotypical highly-valued tasks (see Rule \ref{rule_spotlight}). 

Words matter. In addition to excluding derogatory or discriminatory language (remember that the code of conduct applies to you too, Rule \ref{rule_inclusion}), make the effort to teach yourself the vocabulary and the best ways to communicate to account for every culture and situation. Do not expect people to teach you --it's not their role-- and accept any feedback without being defensive.

And most importantly, take care of your team and prioritize their well-being! Check on them regularly and make sure everyone is comfortable. This represents a great amount of work and you'll need to support each other in the long run.

%Natalia: I don't know if this is the best place, but I'd add the term "well-being".

\section{Have a strong online component of the conference} 
\label{rule_online}

In-person interaction is priceless; however, it is more expensive for some, and even unattainable for others. This inaccessibility is particularly true for global conferences that usually take place in high-income countries, making it financially demanding for international participants and often impossible to attend due to immigration requirements \cite{arendDisparityConferenceRegistration2019,gewinWhatScientistsShould2019}. Online conferences are more inclusive: they do not need a visa or a big budget, and are more accessible to people who may be unable to travel because of health issues or family responsibilities. This means that online conferences have a greater reach, not only in terms of participants but in terms of the tutors and presenters that can participate \cite{atkinsonJournalMedicine20202021}. Furthermore, an online format is more environmentally friendly since it eliminates travel-related emissions \cite{sarabipourChangingScientificMeetings2021,ninerBetterWhomLeveling2021, gattrellComparisonCarbonCosts2021}.

Alternatively, a conference could have a hybrid format with an in-person and online component. This dual format could allow a group of people to interact face-to-face while providing many others the opportunity to participate remotely. The challenge and requirement for this kind of setting would be to make the online component as relevant as the in-person component and not just a consolation prize to the less privileged in the community \cite{ninerBetterWhomLeveling2021}. %Adithi: After the conference is over, the conference materials and videos can be uploaded on free platforms, so that people who were left out of the main event due to any reason, still feel they were cared for and can go to the resources. Also when the event is online, a more timezone friendly approach could be used, all the events if online can be global friendly, people with dependents need hours to take care and the night to rest, if the conference is overnight, they lose sleep and suffer, instead if the conference could be friendly for all regions on certain days just like useR! 2021. 

Take advantage of the online setting for new networking activities that can be inclusive for people with different socialization styles, and accessibility needs. Social events in presencial conferences are often the most exclusive, and they are a very common place where you have code of conduct violations. Having them directly translated into their virtual versions does not address the need for creating opportunities for people to meet and bond. An online event is a great opportunity to create spaces for people who do not enjoy in person networking. Some ideas in this line are: offering the option of written chat only, instead of voice or video conversations, opening events with team work like trivia, offer some events that can be passively enjoyed like movies, yoga sessions, or art displays, where attendants can choose to just sit and enjoy without talking, or have a chat channel to comment on their experiences during the session. Respect people’s limits, preferences, and remember that “the usual” does not necessarily work with your community, and that one single networking activity will never serve the whole community. It is worth trying new and varied activities that might work with subgroups of attendees.

If the conference is online and synchronic (e.g. with live sessions), timezones should be considered: you may change the favored timezone year to year, or work on several timezones in each conference edition. If the conference is hybrid or in-person, be sure the location does not favor the same people over years, move from one continent to another.


\section{Make the conference accessible to people with disabilities}
\label{rule_accessibility}

Conferences are among the least accessible spaces that people with disabilities may encounter \cite{priceAccessImaginedConstruction2009}.
Ironically, accessibility practices are inclusive not only for people with disabilities but can be beneficial to a broad spectrum of people. For instance, having captions is helpful to deaf and hard-of-hearing people, non-native speakers, and everyone in general. 

If the conference is in person, the venue must be accessible for people with mobility limitations. 
Accommodations such as a quiet space for neurodivergent people should also be provided.
Presenters should always speak into a microphone to make it easier for the hard of hearing and for captioners or interpreters to listen to them. 
Regardless of the conference format --online, in person, or hybrid --images used in communications about the conference should be accompanied by alternative text, while videos should have both captions and sound. Do not forget about art shows and movies when making sure that the materials presented are accessible for all. 
Platforms for conference registration and abstract submission, websites, and chat platforms --if used --should be screen-reader friendly and keyboard accessible, with low technology requirements (hardware, software, and internet connection). 
Captioning for presentations should be available in more than one language if possible.
These aspects should be tested well in advance of going live.  

Some practices, such as making accessible slides and presentations, are not yet common practice and will require great efforts from the presenters if they are not used to them. 
For that reason, the organizing team should provide accessibility guidelines for slides and presentations, encourage their use, and be available for any questions they may have.  
Among other things, the guidelines should ask for raw and accessible material to the talks before the conference, e.g., R Markdown, HTML, or \TeX{} files; if presentations are pre-recorded, the speakers should include their video and ensure that their face is visible so that deaf and hard-of-hearing people can read their lips if needed (see \url{https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/accessibility/} for example). 

Most importantly, accessibility practices are not afterthoughts that can be dealt with at the last minute. 
They require time and early decision-making \cite{irishIncreasingParticipationUsing2020}. 
Conversely, inaccessible decisions are hard to course-correct, e.g., when finding out too late that a venue is inaccessible for wheelchairs in an in-person conference. 
On the other hand, it is likely that financial constraints may not allow you to make your conference completely accessible and there will be choices to make (e.g. choosing between captions and interpreters). 
Including people with disabilities, or rather, that are rendered disabled by standard practices in conferences in the organizing team would allow them to take part in the decisions from the beginning, spot right away the inaccessible practices that need to improve (see \textbf{Rule \ref{rule_organizing_team}}), and help make the right choices. As Sasha Costanza-Chock and the Design Justice League say, "center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process".  



\section{Consciously unbias your spotlight roles}
\label{rule_spotlight}

When choosing or inviting people as keynote speakers, program committee, session chairs and other spotlight roles, it is likely that there will not be much diversity in the first set of names. Many of our biased lists are products of the existing systems that have always privileged some groups of people \cite{dwyerNoticeWhoScience2021,swartzScienceValueDiversity2019,wongBuildDiversityScience2020,dignazioUnicornsJanitorsNinjas2020}. Rather than deter us, this implicit and systemic bias should encourage us to look further to find great people that are not routinely in the spotlight. 
Ensuring diversity in each of these roles needs to be a deliberate process. We need to go beyond our narrow and often limited networks to look for, reach out to, invite, encourage, and onboard these people until there is ample representation across the diversity spectrum and dimensions. 

Make sure that every selection committee --the committee looking for keynote speakers, the selection committee for abstracts, the prizes and award committees --are also diverse \cite{swartzScienceValueDiversity2019, wongBuildDiversityScience2020}, and ask them to be aware that everyone has an implicit biases, to recognize them, and try to counteract them.  An inclusive and diverse organizing team (\textbf{Rule \ref{rule_organizing_team}}) is already a great starting point to overcome this bias in other roles. The regional and local communities in your field are also good sources to tap into. 
For example, for useR! 2021, groups like AfricaR (africa-r.org), R-Ladies (rladies.org), MiR (mircommunity.com), Forwards (forwards.github.io), and LatinR (latin-r.com) were fundamental to reach people for the organizing team, potential presenters, to co-lead social events, and attendees; some of them even held spaces to help the members of their groups to prepare abstracts for submission.
When organizing an international academic conference, you may reach local associations, student organizations or other Early Career Researchers groups or communities of practice: ask their needs and barriers, and explicitly invite them to contribute to the conference.Since many conferences are held with the primary goal of displaying cutting-edge work led by senior scientists and academics, early career researchers are often disadvantaged. Diversity should spread among all speaking roles, and the conference should also help raise the profiles of early career researchers, fostering collaboration and building their skills.

Furthermore, consider bringing to the spotlight the people that have contributed to your field in more collaborative  ways \cite{cheng2020x+}. Give awards (see Rule \ref{rule_accessibility}) to those who prepared accessible slides and presentations, for instance, to acknowledge being mindful of inclusiveness. Community building, for instance, is challenging and usually unrewarded when compared to publications or software development \cite{acionWhyChooseCommunity2020}; give the people who deliberately took the time to work on their communities the recognition they deserve. Defy the stereotypical criteria for success by acknowledging these community practices. 
However, do not restrict people from marginalized groups or community-builders to talk or work only in issues related to Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. Recognize their areas of expertise and respect their will regarding participation (or not) in community-building events.


\section{Set fair registration rates and provide financial support when needed}
\label{rule_costs}

Conferences, even virtual ones, should have registration fees for two primary reasons. The first one is that preparing the conference involves a lot of concerted effort and costs money (e.g., commercial registration tools, captioning, or conference venue, if in-person) and this translates to the participation fee. The second reason has to do with psychology -- people value more the things they pay for, and there is a lower attendance rate for free events than for events with registration costs \cite{eventbrite_ultimate_2017}. 

On the other hand, if we are aiming for inclusiveness and representation, the socioeconomic context of participants should be taken into account when determining the registration rates. Usually, there is a higher fee for people from the industry than for academia. A lower fee for non-profit organizations, government employees, or freelancers should also be considered. It is important to include discounts for students as well as for postdocs (early career researchers) to encourage their participation \cite{sarabipourChangingScientificMeetings2021, andalibPostdocQueueLabour2018, kaplanPostdocNot2012}. Since postdoc (or trainee) statuses are not always well-defined in academia and can vary for each country, their payment category should be explicitly defined. You can take into account the cost of living in each country using conversion factors (e.g. from the International Comparison Program report of the World Bank \cite{arendDisparityConferenceRegistration2019}). Consider that, while it is traditional for employers to provide --at least some --conference support in the Global North, this is not the case everywhere. 

Offering scholarships or grants to attend the conference may be counterproductive, as they can be seen as more of a competition and attract people that might not need the money (e.g., when their PI could pay for it) but could apply for it to enrich their CV while filtering out people who do not feel entitled to earn them. If the goal is to help the people who really need it, the language needs to make that clear without shrouding it with fancy-sounding phrases or terms that single out the recipients (e.g. `grant recipient' or `diversity scholar', respectively). Do not call it a scholarship or a grant. Ultimately, it is a fee waiver or a discount for the people who need additional financial support. Also, the process for applicants should be simplified. Applying for loans, grants, and scholarships may be an emotionally demanding task. Do not complicate the attendees' lives by asking for long essays to convince a committee that they deserve your support. For this stage of the process, a certain degree of trust goes a long way -- when they say they need the support, it is best to give them the waiver rather than second guess their eligibility. If the conference resources allow for it, you could even take further steps to offer financial support for activities that help them have the time and resources to be at the conference: child care support, transportation fees and visa financial and administrative support (if in-person), or internet connection services (if virtual). If the conference is virtual, you may offer technical support so that attendees can record their videos, include captions or design accessible presentations.

\section{Don't let language restrict high-quality participation}
\label{rule_language}

In international conferences, English is often the official language. Submissions, presentations, tutorials, and workshops are in English. The platforms, the webpage, and official communications are also in English. While English is the primary language in scientific communication and one official language makes it conducive to communicate widely, opening up the conference to other languages could make it less intimidating to people who are not fluent in English \cite{ninerBetterWhomLeveling2021}. Excluding them may potentially lead to missing innovative contributions due to a language barrier. 

Meeting the need of linguistically diverse audience is an important aspect in inclusion that is often overlooked. Non-native English speakers may feel intimidated to ask questions or raise their views. Providing a welcoming and diverse environment by encouraging the full participation of those individuals is critical (Rule 2). If the panellist or speakers will not be presenting in their native language, it may helpful to rephrase audience questions in a less complex language. Consider letting speakers know in advance that they can ask for a question to be translated to them in their native language and that they can respond in their native language.

Advertising the conference in several languages and considering having non-English workshops and presentations (with or without captions in English) could help overcome this barrier. For instance, hosting one international day/session per conference might be a great place to start!

\section{Actively reach out and promote the conference to people who have been systematically excluded}
\label{rule_communication}
%Andrea: this rule name should be more explicit towards communication, "promoting"
If part of the community has been historically discriminated against, one should emphasize that they are particularly welcome in this event and that the organization will make it a safe and inclusive environment. Publish the diversity statement (e.g., \url{https://user2021.r-project.org/about/diversity_statement/}), the code of conduct and accessibility guidelines. Fee waivers, financial support, and ease of application/registration should also be advertised; people who fear getting rejected when applying for scholarships and waivers may find it relieving that the process will be supportive rather than discriminatory against underrepresented groups. Advertise the conference in multiple languages (rule \ref{rule_language}). Express this welcoming spirit in your communication strategy (social networks, website, brand, and visual identity) to let people know that they are seen, respected, and welcome; that this is their space and community too. 
% Yani: We need to work a little more here, perhaps with some examples.
% Rocío: could add some ideas from here

\section{Do not expect the organizing team to work full time and for free}
\label{rule_pay_team}

%Sara: I think the last rule should be about the process and reinforce to actually discuss and include diversity as a principle and not as a checklist (as it is on the text). Maybe also something about accountability and permanence. I think that this rule go be together with the rule_organizing_team given that it is relative to the team work and their dynamics.
%Sara: copying Yani comment here -  I like the "accountable and permanent" name. I think that an idea about progressive improvement can be mention here, like improve something every edition and no go back on the conquers goals.  Now, to be accountable, you need to be transparent, and you need a clear structure; you get that with the structure of your team, with your declaration and guidelines, and with your action to reinforce those declarations and guidelines (if you have only declarations then you have only empty words, that sound good but you no need to comply. We discuss a lot about this).  For me, one more time, putting together a diverse team is what makes the other thing happened. We can cite The tyranny of structurelessness. The Second Wave, 2(1), 1972. on this rule. Perhaps we can talk about governance.
Having a diverse team and executing inclusive and accessible practices throughout the organizing period --it might be a year or two --may require a lot of effort. The effort is worth it because it strengthens the event and the community making it truly welcoming for everyone. However, having a strong community as the only reward may be enough if you are in a privileged position. Some people and often the minoritized ones do not have institutional support to put time and effort into the organization tasks and do not have the luxury to commit to the organization for free. In addition, tasks such as taking and responding to code of conduct reports, can be emotionally intense work and should be additionally rewarded. Be mindful of each particular context, be flexible with hours or commitments, and revise your budget; if possible, secure funds to offer stipends to them early on. 

\section*{Concluding remarks}

The ten rules stated here can be adapted depending on the conference format and settings.
When organizing useR!2021, we engaged in most of the practices mentioned here, and learned others along the way, so we share them here as part of our learning process. 
We organized useR! during a global pandemic, and as a team, this was a challenging journey. 
Very early on, we tried to recognize that our resources were limited (both in time of the organizing team and financially). 
We had to let go of certain aspects that were important to many of us. 
From that experience, this is our last message: your conference may not become perfectly inclusive and accessible, but the changes you make will make a difference.
Also, keep working to improve inclusion in the next edition of the conference! to document and balance your work, design surveys, ask for feedback from attendees and organizers. Transfer your constructed knowledge to the next organizing team, and adapt year-to-year to include more dimensions of diversity, to address technical and social changes, and to include insights from the new organizing team.  Always remember inclusion is an ambition that organisers can and should continually pursue by allowing room for learning and improvement.
If more conferences and domains apply these rules, the process will get more streamlined, straightforward, and mainstream to adapt with minimal overhead.
And you will make a change towards healthier, stronger, and more inclusive communities.
